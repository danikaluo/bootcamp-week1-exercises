1. Breaking the user interface into different components.

- I like to think of a component in React as a subset of the user interface which accomplishes one thing--for example, the "Add Todo" Bar, the bulleted list of Todos, or the search bar.
- Furthermore, break up each component into potential subcomponents and ultimately React tags such as div, ul, or input.
- It's often very helpful to draw out the user interface by hand and use the 'box' method to group individual sections into components and then sub components.

AddTodo
    take in put and add

TodoList
    string

Search
